<p>We took a major step towards becoming an operational lidar again with Robin and Emily succesfully "closing" the surface of our 2.6 m diameter liquid mirror telescope (see video). One of the many pluses of a liquid mirror is when you move you put the liquid in a bottle and the container on a truck and away you go. But setting up is more difficult, as the mirror must be extremely level or the mirror surface "breaks" and the you have a puddle in the middle instead of a mirror. Since we moved to our new observatory the telescope container had to be completely re-balanced which is a tedious and exacting procedure that PCL "vets" like Steve and I know all too well. Now Robin and Emily are in the club! They have worked hard on this for several weeks and we are very proud of them!
