<a href="http://arctic-emily.blogspot.ca/2013/02/the-many-hats-of-lab-emily.html">Emily's Arctic Adventure: The many hats of Lab Emily</a><br /><a href="http://arctic-emily.blogspot.ca/2013/02/the-many-hats-of-lab-emily.html"><br /></a>Crow Emily is hard at work on the CRL lidar at Eureka, only 1100 km from the North Pole! Follow her blog.<br /><br />I believe based on the FoxInSox post in her blog she wears 500 hats (initially).
