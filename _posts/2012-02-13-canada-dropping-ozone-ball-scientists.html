I noticed the first commenter saying if EC thinks it is important they should cut something else. I would ask what would you do if your income was suddenly cut in half? Cut eating so you could heat your home? Live in a tent and eat better? Don't natter on about EC and priorities. Unless you think they should eliminate providing weather forecasts in Ontario to pay for their ozone program! Or do you believe they should outsource forecasting to another met service?</div></div>
