<p><span style="font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">After a rush of preparation this summer to get the new building ready to go we have run into a string of delays which have keep us from filling the night skies over London with our green beam. Though by August&rsquo;s end we had our stuff ready to go in the new building, there were some issues with some of the building sub-systems that kept us from being able to get the telescope going, that have only recently been (mostly) resolved. Our current hang up is waiting for the delivery of our powerful new laser. We don&rsquo;t want to set up the old laser for a short period, as the differences in the beam positioning would require more work than we thought would be worth it (given the original delivery schedule). So we are busy as ever but not quite lidar-ing yet. But stay tuned, we are hoping things will be happening sooner rather than later.</span></p>
