This past week he wrote a letter to the&nbsp;Victoria Times-Colonist mis-representing several important facts about the Harper Government’s brutal, targeted cuts on Arctic science. Prof. T. Duck (Dalhousie University) replies to Kent’s misrepresentation of the facts in a letter to <a href="http://ipolitics.ca/">iPolitics.ca</a>, concluding:<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">… point-by-point Kent’s claims about PEARL are factually incorrect. Many other claims in the Times-Colonist letter have been so profoundly discredited that it is no small wonder he had the gall to utter them. This past week, in response to criticism he had “misled Canadians”, Kent told an opposition MP that she should talk to “better informed scientists”. What we really need is a better-informed Minister.</blockquote><br />I encourage you to<a href="http://www.ipolitics.ca/2012/09/21/kents-claims-regarding-canadas-arctic-pearl-factually-incorrect/" target="_blank">&nbsp;read the rest of Prof. Duck’s letter on iPolitics.ca.</a>&nbsp;
