Here, the analysis is extended                         to light-absorbing aerosols, such as black carbon, and to measurements from Alert, Canada (82&deg;N, 62&deg;W). The data imply that                         both light scattering and light absorbing aerosols have similar seasonal cycles, independent of location, and they are controlled                         nearly equally by wet scavenging. Removal is particularly efficient at high relative humidities and warm temperatures, which                         suggests that a future warmer and wetter Arctic may also be cleaner. Assuming aerosol pollutants generally have a warming                         effect in the Arctic, such an increase in wet scavenging would represent a negative Arctic climate feedback. </span></p><br/></div><br/><p><span style="font-size:x-small;"><strong>Citation: </strong>Garrett, T.
