How cool is this! Jay Brodie, walking his dog northwest of London saw our laser (Iâ€™m guessing from several km away) and made this video which he posted on youtube in hope that someone would explain what he saw.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/UAGejaauWPE" width="480"></iframe><br /><div style="text-align: left;"><br />Fortunately he found this blog and figured out what was going on. So those in the Northern part of London, ON watch those skies north of the city on clear nights and you might see our beam!</div></div>
