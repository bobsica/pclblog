<div class='p_embed p_image_embed'><br/><img alt="Emilywalk" height="336" src="http://purplecrowlidar.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/emilywalk.jpg?w=300" width="448" /><br/></div><br/><p>This wouldn&#039;t be noteworthy, except that it&#039;s my last walk in the sunshine for a few weeks, and it was a giant four-hour walk in frigid temperatures all the way around Frame Lake in Yellowknife. I (and my camera) are currently thawing out. Also, I heard a raven warble and sing today, and whistle, and he snapped his beak a lot - I hadn&#039;t realized before that they don&#039;t only &quot;Caw!&quot; (although, as usual, it turns out that Wikipedia could have told me that in advance). It was neat, anyways.<br /></p>
