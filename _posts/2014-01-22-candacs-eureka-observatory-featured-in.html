Crow Emily is featured in this timely article on the important scientific work being done in the Canadian high arctic at Eureka:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">For Emily McCullough, a Ph.D student at the University of Western Ontario who is working at the lab, its key benefits include the powerful lessons she’s learned about how to do professional research, from planning a major experiment to anticipating problems like “what happens if the wolves come and chew my cables.”&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">But it’s also a place where she feels the work she does has an impact on Canada’s relationship to the rest of humanity. “Canada’s got a heck of a lot of the Arctic,” Ms. McCullough says. “It would be really great if we could contribute something to the understanding of it as a whole.”</blockquote><a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/the-north/how-canadas-arctic-lab-keeps-a-watchful-eye-on-climate-change/article16423612/#dashboard/follows/">How Canada’s Arctic lab keeps a watchful eye on climate change - The Globe and Mail</a>
