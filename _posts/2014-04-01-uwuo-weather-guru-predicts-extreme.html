<i>excerpted from the London Freee Presss, 01 April 2014:</i><br /><br />A real scientific study with formulas and stuff was released today by a bunch of scientists including Prof. R. Sica, Professor of Whether at The University of Western University Ontario. The study boldly predicts that the winter of 2013-2014 will be one of the coldest on record. Mustang Scientist Sica told this paper that: "we’ve gone over the results with a fine tooth comb and are highly certain that a combination of highs, lows and other emotions will result in a very cold winter, particularly in January and February 2014." Sica also said: “don’t put those snow shovels away until March.”<br /><br />The study will be submitted to the prestigious journal Nauturel sometime this summer .
