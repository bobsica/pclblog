As always a great 1 April email from the Space Physics &amp; Aeronomy Section of the American Geophysical Union.<br /><br /><strong>Citation Club Membership</strong><br /><strong><br /></strong>Do not break the chain. In your next publication, cite a paper by every one of the authors in the list below. Then remove the top author, add your name to the bottom of the list, and mail this message to ten of your colleagues who are not on the list. One of our colleagues who broke the chain lost the supporting research and technology grant he had previously successfully renewed a dozen times. A colleague who continued the chain soon had a sufficiently high H-index to both become an AGU fellow and be nominated for fellowship in the NAS.<br /><br />D.N. Baker<br />P.A. Isenberg<br />P.J. Chi<br />R.E. Ergun<br />J.A. Goldstein<br />J.E. Borovski<br />A. Bagenal<br />(add your name here)<br /><br />
