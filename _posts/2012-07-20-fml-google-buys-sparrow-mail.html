So guess who just took the last few days to switch over to Sparrow. Iâ€™m on a crappy role here, first all my blogs were on Posterous and now Sparrow has flown the coop. I hope they live up to their promise of continued support unlike Posterous who left its users out in the cold with no support. That being said I have a support issue going back and forth with the Sparrow people and they have been terrific, answering me as recently as last night when you would have thought they would be partying! <br /><br />added 30 July 13: put tumblr on that list as well!
