<p>A summer of hard work and we have moved from the Delaware Observatory to our new facility, Echo Base. Our next step in the project is getting our new laser installed, which we hope to have done before year's end. We'll keep you posted!</p><br/><p>[vimeo http://www.vimeo.com/17037859 w=500&h=283]</p><br/><p>&nbsp;</p>
