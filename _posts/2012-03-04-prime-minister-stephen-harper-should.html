<div class="posterous_autopost"><div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry"><div class="posterous_quote_citation">"For a western democracy, the Harper government has been moving entirely in the wrong direction when it comes to allowing freedom of speech for federal scientists." <a href="http://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorials/article/1140253--prime-minister-stephen-harper-should-set-scientists-free-says-nature"> thestar.com</a><br /><br /></div>The Toronto Star weighed in today on its Editorial page on the recent publication in the journal Nature scolding the Harper government's on its insistence for muzzling federal scientists. I have had this happen to several colleagues, even to the level of having permission denied for trivial contacts (e.g. help from reports for local "Ask a Scientist" type columns). Reminiscent to me of the problems federal scientists working in the area of climate had in the U.S. had during the Busch administration.</div></div>
