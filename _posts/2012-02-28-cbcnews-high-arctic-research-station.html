<div class="posterous_autopost"><div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry"><div class="p_embed p_image_embed">via <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2012/02/28/science-pearl-arctic-research.html">cbc.ca</a></div>Sadly today marks the official announcement of the closure of Canada's PEARL Observatory. We have been unable to secure funding, primarily because we no longer have any government atmospheric or climate programs we can apply to for funds. The new observatory promised for 2017 is 1300 km to the south and is not in the high Arctic. Being in this location was important for being able to take measurements last spring during the largest Arctic ozone hole yet observed.</div></div>
