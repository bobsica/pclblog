<a href="http://cedarweb.hao.ucar.edu/wiki/index.php/Community:Email_21feb13">Atmospheric Model on your iOS device</a><br /><a href="http://cedarweb.hao.ucar.edu/wiki/index.php/Community:Email_21feb13"><br /></a>Kudos to Al Hedin, who for several decades now has been the leader of a project to make the most comprehensive model of the atmosphere from the surface to the the exosphere (e.g. 500 km altitude). I never thought pouring over the MSIS FORTRAN code as a grad student that someday I would have (not only!) a phone in my pocket but one that could run that model, which needed a DEC VAX to compile (yup, pre-PC/Mac).<br /><br />My new favourite iPhone app! This <em>free</em> app will be a useful professional, student and outreach tool.
