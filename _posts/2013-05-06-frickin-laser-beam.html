Great snap by Rob Weryk of the PCL in action: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/13794832@N00/8714248822/" target="_blank">&lt;dr evil&gt;Frickin' "Laser" Beam&lt;/dr&gt;</a><br /><br />Says Rob: "I went to take some star pics and noticed the Purple Crow Lidar was running ... there is also a satellite flare visible.”<br /><br />For the record: the PCL is not responsible for hitting that satellite… not this time :–)
