<a href="http://www.rasclondon.ca/index.php/meetings">The Old Crow Lectures on the Aurora: Friday, 19 April @ RASC-London</a><br /><a href="http://www.rasclondon.ca/index.php/meetings"><br /></a>I’ve been invited by the Royal Astronomical Society of London to give a public talk:<br /><br /><strong>The Aurora Borealis and Space Weather</strong><br />Space Weather is the study of the interaction of the particles which flow from the Sun with Earth’s atmosphere. This talk will describe the visual result apparent to us on the surface, the Northern (and Southern) Lights, as well as give a lay description of a cutting edge of research: how can the particles from the Sun affect weather on the surface?<br />Come on out if just to heckle :–)
