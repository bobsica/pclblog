## New Blog, New ceilometer

* Hope you like the new blog look. Thanks to the awesome github community getting away from a commercial service and to a light, fast markdown blog was easy peasy. Thanks world.

* Also thanks to the [Faculty of Science at Western](https://www.uwo.ca/sci/), we were able to get a ceilometer for Cronyn Observatory. The image above shows off the ability of the ceilometer to characterise the troposphere. Much more on this to come.

## Quick Ceilometer Facts

1. It's pronounced "see-lo-meter". My Nouveau Joisey accent tends to put anywhere from 2 to 4 extra syllables between the see, the lo and the meter. Just ignore that.

2. The ceilometer is identical in principle to a lidar. Here is a [quick lidar tutorial](http://pcl.physics.uwo.ca/science/lidarintro/).

3. We will be collaborating with the Remote Sensing Group [at MeteoSwiss](http://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/home/measurement-and-forecasting-systems/atmosphere/lidar-and-ceilometers.html) to do some way cool studies with chains of these instruments. More later.

4. It looks like a "plucky droid". I like that.
