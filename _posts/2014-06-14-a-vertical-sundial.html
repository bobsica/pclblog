The photo below shows a new take (for me) on the a sundial, mounted vertically on a building instead of horizontally. You can see from the shadow that is was around noon. Also indicated (I think) are zodiacal positioning, at least that’s what the symbols looked like. And to top it off look carefully and you can see that now only did a Crow snap the picture, a Crow posed in it!<br /><br /><center><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/91699523@N05/14418141705/"><img border="0" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2936/14418141705_1cee6094d7_b.jpg" height="400" style="margin: 5px;" width="400" /></a></center><br />Location:&nbsp;Murtenhof, Mürten, Switzerland
