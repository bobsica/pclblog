<p>Got through about 400 U &amp; A posters then blitzed the P &amp; SA with a little bit of geology for the heck of it.</p><br/><br/><h1>Noted</h1><br/><br/><ul><br/><li><p>don&rsquo;t put your picture on your poster. I understand why you would, but I look at it and see a car or real estate ad and expect 25% off at least for reading your posters</p></li><br/><li><p>don&rsquo;t use the same logo on your poster as you&rsquo;re football team does on the helmet. Use the staid one on the letterhead your University uses for deaths and termination notices. I can&rsquo;t explain why just trust me on this.</p></li><br/><li><p>OK, gtg, late for the Social Media Soiree and I have no idea what the heck it is? I thought Soiree was ice cream made with water instead of cream?</p></li><br/></ul><br/><br/><br/><h1>Posters Ramblings</h1><br/><br/><ul><br/><li><p>a couple posters dealing with teleconnections. I find this fascinating, the notion/fact that the atmosphere responses in a non-local manner to different effects. Ferreting them out is useful and I imagine fun, understanding them is tough. Posters <strong>109</strong> and <strong>269</strong> had some interesting results.</p></li><br/><li><p>not giving number but poor ### printed their poster 4'x6' but it the boards are 4' HEIGHT by 6' width</p></li><br/><li><p>Poster <strong>128</strong> makes available to us all the HIPPO data base of recent aircraft measurements and analysis for flight paths all over North America (maybe more?). Looks worth checking out.</p></li><br/><li><p>Trending: several people have put instruments on cargo ships to get a wide range of latitudes/longitudes covered. No pirates appeared to be co-investigators.</p></li><br/><li><p>143: Yo @znarfoz: Bruhl et al showed results for background stratospheric aerosols. They estimate carbonyl sulfide (COS) is the source for 70%, with some volcanic contributions by SO2.</p></li><br/><li><p>212: Pfister et al. showed aircraft measurements from the AATREX campaign of water vapor in the tropical troposphere layer. Changes in water vapor in this region have a huge affect on global temperature. Look forward to seeing more of these excellent measurements.</p></li><br/><li><p>221: Loved this (Canadian!) student paper by Haga et al on ice nucleation in mixed phase clouds due to fungal spores. Wished I had been able to talk to her. I overheard her saying they were wondering if the spores could be lofted in the high arctic. At the <a href="http://www.candac.ca">CANDAC lab in Eureka</a> we have an experiment that measures pollen brought up from middle latitudes to the high arctic. So why not fungal spores?</p></li><br/><li><p>263: another interesting Canadian student paper by Normand et al using OSIRIS satellite measurements to find cloud tops in the UTLS.</p></li><br/><li><p>379: Enviroment Canada sciences show that NO2 and SO2 hot spots are present over the minds at the tar sands. Nuff said.</p></li><br/><li><p>quick tour of the planetary papers, the Mars ionospheric work is neat and I enjoyed Girzain et al poster <strong>SA13A-1879</strong> that derived a Chapman profile for the Mars ionosphere. Definitely stealing that for my course next term, nice complement to the derivation I do for Earth. Or an exam problem maybe, ssshhhhh thank Goodness my students don&rsquo;t read this.</p></li><br/><li><p>promised Geology: <em>1577</em> Lebrun et al showed the affects on cooling on a magma ocean on Earth on the choice of atmosphere. As the amount of water vapor increases relative to CO2 the cooling can slow down by 2x.</p></li><br/></ul>
